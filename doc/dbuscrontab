# This is a system-wide dbuscron config file.
# Lines starting with `#' are ignored.
# Format of this file (table with whitespace-separated records):
#
# bus type sender interface path member destination arguments command
#
# Any field can have asterisk only (*) to match any value, each field can have
# multiple values separated with comma (,), matching any of these values will
# match. Only last (command) field can contain spaces. Bus field can be either
# `S' for system bus or `s' for session bus, type field can have one of signal,
# method_return, method_call or error values. Arguments consist of
# semicolon-separated values to match arguments of DBUS events.
#
# Examples:
#
# Run command for every DBUS event:
# * * * * * * * * command
#
# Run command on system bus event named Event with type either method_call or
# method_return:
# S method_call,method_return * * * * Event * command
#
# The same as above, by check if second argument equals either `foo' or `bar',
# or first arguments is baz:
# S method_call,method_return * * * * Event ;foo,;bar,baz command
#
# More practical examples:
#
# Run command on incoming call:
# S signal * com.nokia.csd.Call /com/nokia/csd/call Coming * * run-standalone.sh incoming-call-hook.sh
#
# Run command on GPRS connected:
# S signal * com.nokia.csd.GPRS.Context /com/nokia/csd/gprs/0 Connected * * run-standalone.sh gprs-connected-hook.sh
#
# This file can also contain any number of environmental variables settings, e.g.:
# PATH = /usr/bin:/usr/sbin
#
# When command is running there're a number of environmental variables set so
# the script can check DBUS event data. The variables are:
#   DBUS_ARG# (where # is the number from 0 to DBUS_ARGN) - arguments of event,
#   DBUS_ARGN - number of event arguments,
#   DBUS_SENDER - event sender name,
#   DBUS_DEST - event destination name,
#   DBUS_IFACE - event interface,
#   DBUS_PATH - event object path,
#   DBUS_MEMBER - called event member,
#   DBUS_BUS - bus event came from (`session' or `system'),
#   DBUS_TYPE - event type as described above.
